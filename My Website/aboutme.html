        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I am originally from a suburb right outside of Columbus, Ohio called Dublin, Ohio. I moved to Boulder, Colorado about 3 years ago to come to school at The University of Colorado, Boulder. I have always loved working creatively with technology so I am potentially interested in working in digital marketing after I graduate.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love to do anything outside including skiing, hiking, and running. I also love spending time with my friends and watching movies. To the right are some pictures with my friends and family in the past year!</p>
